# Hi there, I'm Akilesh! 👋

**Senior Cloud & DevOps Engineer | Aspiring Platform Architect**

I design and build scalable cloud infrastructure, deterministic automation, and developer‑first tooling across AWS, Terraform, Python, and modern CI/CD. My work focuses on predictability, compliance, and reproducibility — from infrastructure pipelines to AI‑assisted developer workflows.

I apply enterprise‑grade rigor to everything I build: clean architecture, modular workflows, and documentation that scales.
